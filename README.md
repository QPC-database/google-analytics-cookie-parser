# google-analytics-cookie-parser
A WIP forensics tool for Windows written in Python, for parsing Google Analytics cookies.

### [Download latest version here](https://github.com/pbeart/google-analytics-cookie-parser/releases/latest)

### GACP currently supports:
* Reading and parsing cookies.sqlite from Firefox v3+
* Analysing and parsing all relevant Google Analytics cookies (\_ga, \_\_utma, \_\_utmb, \_\_utmz)
* Presenting all available information for a given domain

### GACP is currently only tested on Firefox v3+ with \_ga cookies, and as always any critical evidence should be double-checked by manually inspecting the relevant cookies
